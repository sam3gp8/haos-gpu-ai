# Setup & Build Guide — HAOS GPU-AI Universal

Two phases. **Phase 1** builds and flashes the first image on your workstation.
**Phase 2** puts the repo on GitHub so CI tracks upstream nightly and the device
self-updates. After Phase 1 you have a booting GPU image; after Phase 2 updates
are automatic. The first image is always a manual flash — OTA takes over after.

## Prerequisites (build host)
- x86_64 Linux with **Docker**, `git`, `xz`.
- **~80 GB free disk** and **16 GB+ RAM** — a full HAOS build is heavy.
- You do NOT need Buildroot's dependencies on the host: the build runs inside
  HAOS's own builder container. You only need Docker.

---

## Phase 1 — Build the OS

### 1. Put the tree in a git repo and add the upstream submodule
```bash
cd haos-gpu-ai                       # the delivered tree
git init
git add -A && git commit -m "HAOS GPU-AI external tree"

# add the HAOS submodule (this is what .gitmodules describes)
git submodule add -b dev https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system.git upstream
git -C upstream submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Pin the HAOS release you want to build
Pick a tag from https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases.
```bash
HAOS_TAG=14.2                         # example — use a real current tag
git -C upstream fetch --tags
git -C upstream checkout "tags/${HAOS_TAG}"
git -C upstream submodule update --init --recursive   # buildroot is nested
```

### 3. Confirm the kernel <-> NVIDIA-driver pin
```bash
grep BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE \
  upstream/buildroot-external/configs/generic_x86_64_defconfig
```
The pinned NVIDIA driver must support that kernel. Reference points (verify on
NVIDIA's Unix driver page): 550 tops out ~6.11; 580.126.18 fixes the 6.19
module build; 595.84 is the current Production Branch. **The device-verified
build is HAOS 17.3 (kernel 6.12.85), and the pin is 595.84** (already the
default; it also covers the 6.18.37 kernel of a future 18.1 bump, which is
currently blocked because that kernel tarball 404s on the kernel.org CDN).
Only change the pin if your kernel differs:
```
# external/package/haos-compute-nvidia/Config.in
#   default "595.84"
```

### 4. Generate the RAUC signing CA (once)
```bash
./external/scripts/generate-ca.sh ./pki
# pki/cert.pem = PUBLIC (commit later)   pki/key.pem = SECRET (never commit)
```

### 5. Stage the signing material where the build reads it
```bash
mkdir -p output
cp pki/cert.pem cert.pem        && cp pki/key.pem key.pem
cp pki/cert.pem output/cert.pem && cp pki/key.pem output/key.pem
chmod 600 key.pem output/key.pem
```

### 6. Run the preflight gate (fail fast, seconds not minutes)
```bash
./external/scripts/preflight-check.sh nvidia-amd
```
Fix anything it flags (bad driver pin, unreachable asset) before building.

### 7. Build inside the HAOS builder container
Recommended order: `intel-amd` first (in-tree drivers only - proves the whole
pipeline on any kernel with almost no build risk), then `nvidia-amd` once you've
pinned an NVIDIA driver that supports your kernel, then `all`. Set `PROFILE=`
accordingly below.
```bash
docker build -t haos-gpu-builder ./upstream       # builder from the submodule's own Dockerfile

docker run --rm --privileged \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace \
  -e ota_compatible=haos-generic-x86-64-gpu-ai \
  -e PROFILE=nvidia-amd \
  haos-gpu-builder \
  bash -c "./external/scripts/build.sh"
```
If `docker build ./upstream` doesn't match your HAOS version's build environment,
set a published builder image instead (see the workflow's `BUILDER_IMAGE`) and
run `./external/scripts/build.sh` inside it.

### 8. Verify the artifacts
```bash
ls -lh output/images/*.img.xz output/images/*.raucb
```
Expect a raw disk image and a signed bundle. (If no `.raucb` appears, see
Troubleshooting — some HAOS versions build the bundle from their top-level
Makefile rather than a Buildroot post-image hook.)

### 9. Flash the first image
**DANGER: `dd` overwrites the entire disk. Triple-check the device with `lsblk`.**
```bash
lsblk                                 # identify the target, e.g. /dev/sdb
xz -dc output/images/haos_generic-x86-64-*.img.xz | \
  sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=direct conv=fsync
sync
```

### 10. Boot and verify GPU bring-up
On the target, after first boot:
```bash
journalctl -u gpu-autodetect --no-pager     # which vendor was detected + loaded
lsmod | grep -E 'nvidia|amdgpu|i915'
cat /usr/lib/haos-gpu/*.contract             # host contract markers
nvidia-smi                                   # NVIDIA hosts only
ls -l /dev/dri /dev/kfd /dev/nvidia*         # compute nodes + 0666 perms
```

---

## Phase 2 — GitHub (CI, Releases, OTA)

### 1. Point the code at your real repo
```bash
NEW=myorg/haos-gpu-ai
grep -rl 'your-org/haos-gpu-ai' . | xargs -r sed -i "s#your-org/haos-gpu-ai#${NEW}#g"
```

### 2. Commit and push (submodule travels as a gitlink)
```bash
cp pki/cert.pem ota/gpu-ai-ca.pem     # optional: keep the public CA in-repo
git add -A && git commit -m "Configure repo + public CA"
git remote add origin git@github.com:myorg/haos-gpu-ai.git
git push -u origin main
```
Anyone cloning uses `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

### 3. Add the two Actions secrets
Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions, or with the `gh` CLI:
```bash
gh secret set RAUC_SIGNING_CERT < pki/cert.pem
gh secret set RAUC_SIGNING_KEY  < pki/key.pem
```
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by Actions.

### 4. First CI run — manual, smallest surface
```bash
gh workflow run build-and-track.yml -f profile=nvidia-amd -f force_tag="${HAOS_TAG}"
gh run watch
```
The preflight gate fails the job in seconds if the driver pin is wrong. Fix
`Config.in`, push, re-run. Iterate to green, then try `-f profile=all`.

### 5. What a green run publishes
A GitHub Release tagged with the upstream version, containing:
- `haos_generic-x86-64-<ver>.raucb` (signed with YOUR CA)
- `haos_generic-x86-64-<ver>.img.xz`
- `version-gpu-ai.json`

### 6. Automatic upstream tracking
The daily cron (`17 4 * * *`) checks `homeassistant/operating-system` for a new
tag; if found it builds the **full** image (`profile=all`) and publishes a
Release. Nothing else to do.

### 7. On-device OTA (decoupled from the Supervisor)
The flashed image runs `haos-gpu-updater.timer` daily, pointed at your repo. It
pulls the newest Release `.raucb`, verifies the `compatible` string, and
`rauc install`s it; reboot activates the new slot.
Manual update:
```bash
curl -fsSLO <release-asset-url>/haos_generic-x86-64-<ver>.raucb
rauc install haos_generic-x86-64-<ver>.raucb
reboot
```
Because the image uses a custom RAUC `compatible` + your keyring, the HAOS
Supervisor **cannot** overwrite it with a stock bundle. That is the decoupling.

---

## The whole flow in one breath
Flash once (Phase 1) -> push + set two secrets + one manual CI run (Phase 2) ->
after that, CI tracks upstream nightly and the device self-updates from your
Releases.

## Troubleshooting
- **Preflight fails on the driver ceiling** — bump the NVIDIA pin in
  `external/package/haos-compute-nvidia/Config.in`.
- **NVIDIA `kernel-open` compile error** — almost always the driver/kernel pair;
  bump the driver, or adjust `MODULE_MAKE_OPTS` in the package `.mk`.
- **`CONFIG_DRM_XE` unknown for your kernel** — stay on `profile=nvidia-amd`, or
  delete the two `DRM_XE` lines from `external/kernel/gpu-ai.config`.
- **No `.raucb` produced** — your HAOS version may create the bundle via its
  top-level Makefile instead of a Buildroot post-image hook; run that target in
  the container after `build.sh`.
- **Runner out of disk/time** — use a larger or self-hosted runner (the workflow
  already frees space and sets a long timeout).
- **RAUC signing path** — if the build ignores your `cert.pem`/`key.pem`, confirm
  where `upstream/buildroot-external/scripts/rauc.sh` expects them for your pin
  and copy accordingly (we stage both repo-root and `output/` to cover both).

## Appendix: real-world build gotchas (a fresh machine will hit these)

These were all encountered bootstrapping a build on a clean workstation. None
are bugs in the tree; they're environment issues with known fixes.

### Pre-seed the assets that don't auto-fetch
Buildroot can't reliably fetch the kernel or the NVIDIA `.run` in a sandboxed
builder. Seed them into `dl/` from the **host** (which has network) before building:
```bash
mkdir -p dl/linux dl/linux-headers dl/cmake
curl -fL -o dl/linux/linux-6.12.85.tar.xz https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.12.85.tar.xz
cp dl/linux/linux-6.12.85.tar.xz dl/linux-headers/
curl -fL -o dl/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-595.84.run https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/595.84/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-595.84.run
```

### The builder image needs network + CA certs + docker.io
HAOS's `upstream/Dockerfile` installs `docker-ce` from `download.docker.com`,
which is often blocked. Build a patched variant that (a) drops the docker-ce
apt block, (b) keeps `ca-certificates` (TLS) and adds `docker.io` +
`curl` to the build-tools layer:
```bash
# strip the docker-ce block, keep the toolchain
awk '/^# Docker$/{skip=1;next} skip&&/^# Build tools$/{skip=0} !skip' \
    upstream/Dockerfile > upstream/Dockerfile.nodind
# add ca-certificates, docker.io, curl to the build-tools apt list, then:
docker build -t haos-gpu-builder -f upstream/Dockerfile.nodind upstream
```

### Docker daemon on the host can't reach the internet from containers
Symptom: `wget` inside the builder says "Network is unreachable" though the host
is fine. Fixes, in order:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1   # most common cause on a fresh Docker install
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-docker.conf   # persist
```
Then run the build container with `--network=host`.

### Buildroot won't run as root without a flag
The builder runs as root; GNU tar/others refuse to `configure` as root. Pass:
```bash
docker run ... -e BR2_DL_DIR=/workspace/dl \
  haos-gpu-builder bash -c 'export FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1 BR2_DL_DIR=/workspace/dl; \
    STRICT=0 PROFILE=all ./external/scripts/build.sh'
```

### No docker daemon *inside* the builder → data-partition preload fails
`create-data-partition.sh` uses docker-in-docker to preload Supervisor images.
`build.sh` already patches this out at build time (the images are pulled on
first boot instead — proven fine on a network-connected box). If you see
`docker: command not found` from that script, confirm the patch fired
(`grep GPU_AI-SKIP upstream/buildroot-external/package/hassio/create-data-partition.sh`).

### Cleaning the build
Only two safe states: touch nothing, or remove **all** of `output/`. A partial
clean (e.g. `rm -rf output/target` while leaving `output/build`) breaks the
skeleton package. To force a clean rebuild:
```bash
sudo umount output/target/* output/images/* 2>/dev/null
sudo rm -rf output
```
The `dl/` cache is preserved, so nothing re-downloads.

### First boot: Secure Boot
A self-built HAOS image is not signed by Microsoft's shim CA. If the machine's
UEFI throws `error: shim_lock protocol not found`, **disable Secure Boot** (and
CSM/Legacy) in the BIOS. For a 24 GB GPU also enable **Above 4G Decoding** and
**Resizable BAR**.

### First boot: be patient, and don't touch Docker
First boot resizes the data partition and the Supervisor pulls HA Core over the
network (5–15 min, longer on USB). The banner shows `Core: landingpage` until
it's done. **Do not restart Docker during this window** — it interrupts the pull.
