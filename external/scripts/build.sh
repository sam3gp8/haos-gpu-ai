# Drives a full HAOS GPU/AI build. Intended to run INSIDE the HAOS builder
# container (see .github/workflows/build-and-track.yml) but also works on any
# host that satisfies Buildroot's prerequisites.
#
# Key mechanics:
#   * BR2_EXTERNAL chains BOTH trees (colon-separated): HAOS's own
#     buildroot-external first, then ours. This is the supported Buildroot way
#     to layer external trees and keeps the submodule pristine.
#   * ota_compatible is exported so HAOS's RAUC templates bake our custom
#     `compatible` string into both the running system and the bundle.

# here in our tree rather than as a committed change to upstream.

# fail "docker: command not found". The preload is an OPTIMISATION, not required:
# a network-connected HAOS pulls Core + Supervisor on first boot (hardware-proven).
# Comment the whole `container=$(docker run ...)` .. `docker exec` block via a
# ROBUST line-range match, preserving the containerd-snapshotter marker and the
# AppArmor setup that follow. Idempotent; submodule commit stays clean.

#    haos-generic-x86-64-gpu-ai, and stock bundles are rejected PRE-signature.
